You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle. You need to find all three angles for this triangle. If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle), then you must return all angles as 0 (zero). The angles should be represented as a list of integers in ascending order. Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).

Input: The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.
Output: Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.

Precondition: 
0 < a,b,c â‰¤ 1000
