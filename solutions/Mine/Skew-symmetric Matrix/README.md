In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, a skew-symmetric matrix(also known as an antisymmetric or antimetric) is a square matrix A whose transpose is also its negative. This means it satisfies the equation A = −AT. If the entry in the i-th row and j-th column is aij, i.e. A = (aij) then the symmetric condition becomes aij = −aji.

You should determine whether the specified square matrix is skew-symmetric or not.

You can find more details on Skew-symmetric matrices on its Wikipedia page.

Input: A square matrix as a list of lists with integers.
Output: If the matrix is skew-symmetric or not as a boolean.

Precondition: 0 < N < 5
